# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 14 - [TITLE]

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above (14 and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days. 
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)

> The aim of this project is to simulate vitamin D production in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiaea), as well as optimise the reaction in various ways (insert ways)

## Project overview
Describe how your project is organized ...
This project is organized with the text of the report being presented in the file [Report.ipynb](Report.ipynb) and the code for the results presented are located in different files across the repository.
The project code is meant to be read in the following order:

0. [0-Code_Memote.ipynb] (0-Code_Memote.ipynb) - this document covers the memote analyses of four different yeast models.

1. [1-Code_Heterologous-pathway.ipynb](1-Code_Heterologous-pathway.ipynb) - this document covers the model and addition of the heterologous reactions.

2. [2-Code_Carbon-sources.ipynb](2-Code_Carbon-sources.ipynb) - this document covers analysis of what carbon source may be most efficient.

3. [3-Code_PPP.ipynb](3-Code_PPP.ipynb) - this document covers the phenotypic phase plan analysis of manual knock-outs.

4. [4-Code_Automatic-optimization.ipynb] (4-Code_Automatic-optimization.ipynb) - This document covers automatic optimization attempts such as optGene



the [Model code Yeast8.ipynb](Model code Yeast8.ipynb) file.
