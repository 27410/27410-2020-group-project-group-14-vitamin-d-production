    "The product introduced in this project is vitamin D3, most commonly referred to as simply vitamin D. The vitamin is essential to the intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium and phosphate. It can be produced by the skin through a reaction dependent on UVB light – from sunlight [1], and is also present in egg yolks and fish [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular use of vitamin D is as a supplement, specially for countries in the Northern hemisphere, with long winter-nights without much sunlight available [10]. More than 10% of Europeans have severe vitamin D deficiency, while the number for non-severe deficiency is <20% for Northern Europeans and 30-60% for the rest of Europe [4]. However, deficiency is also widespread in Asia, specially China. [3]\n",

    "A new usage – while still as supplement – is taking vitamin D as a preventative against infection with COVID-19 (a respiratory infection), which is a pandemic that begun in 2019 and is still ravaging through the world at over one million dead [5]. Some trial studies have found no impact when taking vitamin D [6], while other researchers are still conducting experiments to elucidate the matter further [7]. Nonetheless, it is known that vitamin D can alleviate the risk of respiratory infections in general [8,9].\n",

    "Budding yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) is one of the most used microorganisms in human history [12, 13]. The first evidence of the use of microorganisms is suspected to involve some kind of yeast, plausibly *S. cerevisiae*, and dates back to Ancient Egypt [14]. Today, this organism is used in a wide variety of productions, ranging from ethanol and small organic compounds to cancer medication [15].\n",
    "\n",
    "One important difference between *S. cerevisiae* and all used bacterial microorganisms is that yeasts are eukaryotes, which means they have, among other things, cellular compartments. This makes a large difference in terms of complexity, as transport between different compartments needs to be factored in. Furthermore, it allows for more complex pathways to be split up between  locations where the local environment might be more hospitable. Due to the large usage of the organism, it has been extensively studied and is popular for usage in the industry, making it a good candidate for the production of vitamins and other biochemicals [13].\n",
    "The yeast also has many well-established DNA cassettes, making construction of the heterologous strain more efficient [15].\n",

    "While the organism has many advantages and is widely used, it has some drawbacks as well. Usually, industry and academia has used glucose and disaccharides as substrate and carbon source, however this is neither environmentally sustainable, nor is it necessarily cheap. From these perspectives, it would be more advantageous to use a strain which can naturally use cellulose, lignin or xylose as substrate, which are abundant in nature.\n",
    "Another issue using *S. cerevisiae* can be the unwanted production of ethanol (even under aerobic conditions, dubbed the crabtree effect), since the cell factor will divert the carbon and energy towards production of ethanol rather than the wanted metabolite [13].\n",

    "Vitamin D has been experimentally produced in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* at a yield of 1.07 g/L in a fed-batch fermentation. [11]\n",
    "Since *S. cerevisiae* naturally produces zymosterol, this can be used as a precursor to produce 5alpha-Cholest-8-en-3beta-ol through a heterologous reaction in the Genome-scale model of *S. cerevisiae*. From there, another reaction can be added to produce lathosterol. Lastly 7-dehydrocholesterol can be produced through a third and final added reaction. The details can be seen and read in 4.1.\n",

    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the the production of 7-dehydrocholesterol in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, starting with the addition of the human biosynthetic pathway to the Yeast8 GSM. Here, a maximal production of 7-dehydrocholesterol was reached at 0.042 mmol gDW<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To attempt optimization of this, manual knockouts and alterations to the growth media were simulated. Both methods did not yield any significant improvements to the production of the target compound. On the other hand, the methods illuminated a robustness in the model with regards to knockouts. Thus, a lot of effort is required to significantly alter the phenotypic phase plane simulated for production of 7-dehydrocholesterol. The results also showed that the media has a possible significant effect on both the growth and the heterologous production, due to the model being glucose-limited. A more thorough optimization of the growth media could be employed to increase the flux for both pathways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, automatic optimization strategies were used to improve the production in the cell factory. However, due to the large size of the model, both in terms of genes, reactions and metabolites, the automatic optimization strategies took a very long time to compute. Nonetheless, the optGene optimization did not yield any results, which could be fruitful for the increased production of 7-dehydrocholesterol. Furthermore, each computation took between one and three hours, which was infeasible due to the server down-time. Therefore, this approach was abandoned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, FSEOF analysis of the product formation was performed. This indicated that phosphate uptake was downregulated when the target compound flux increased. Therefore, simulations were conducted with a knockout mutation as well as engineering of the media. Here, it was found that phenotypic phase plan topology could be altered by changing the phosphate concentration in the media, but that it also greatly decreased the capacity for production of 7-dehydrocholesterol. This approach was therefore put aside, but it could be included in subsequent media optimization projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Co-factor swapping was also attempted, however this further lead to a sharp decrease of production. This method may also be interesting to look further into, as the reactions used, utilise NADPH. Thus it would be relevant to ensure higher flux of the co-factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, the problems could be solved in a couple of ways. First, another model could have been chosen as the starting point. However, the two smaller models that were considered did not have the required metabolites ferro- and ferri-cytochrome b5, which means that they would have to be added, before the heterologous pathway could function. While possible, it requires a greater understanding of the reduction potential pathways in yeast. Second, one could use a faster server. DTU students have access to the High Performance Computing (HPC) server, but this requires some expertise in optimizing the script for a non-iPython interface, which was too time-consuming. If this is achieved, then it would be interesting to try other optimization algorithms such as optKnock and optGene, to explore the various ways this cell factory can be optimized. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this project we tried to optimize the production of vitamin D in the cell factory *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. We chose to use Yeast8 as the starting model of this work, as it represented a modern and comprehensive GEM.  \n",
    "We added a heterologous pathway for the production of 7-dehydrocholesterol, which is the precursor of vitamin D3. Following this, we applied various optimization strategies to increase the flux of the production pathway. However, none of the attempted optimization strategies yielded any decisive results. increased computing resources could be used to generate meaningful results using automatic optimization strategies, such as OptGene. However, preliminary results from the analyses show that optimization of the growth media looks very promising with regards to achieving high production flux and growth rates. This can serve as the starting point for future optimizations, to achieve a production higher than the current 0.0412 mmol gDW<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. \n"
