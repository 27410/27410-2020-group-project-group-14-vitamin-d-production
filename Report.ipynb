    "Vitamin D, of which the most common types are D3 (cholecalciferol) and D2 (ergocalciferol), in the human body has an impact on intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium and phosphate (Trautvetter 2014). Vitamin D3 is synthesized in the skin through a reaction dependent on UVB radiation (Holick 1980). Both vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 can be provided through the diet as a few food sources such as egg yolks and fish oils contain both vitamins (Brown #). Adequate levels of vitamin D, defined by serum 25-hydroxyl vitamin D (25(OH)D), which is a 1:1 mixture of D3 and D2, in the human body is still discussed. Levels above 50 nmol/L are required to maintain muscoskeletal health, though a level higher than 75 nmol/L can be required to maximize the muscoskeletal health and gain extraskeletal benefits (Cianferotti #). Thus, levels below 25 nmol/L can be defined as extreme vitamin D deficiency, levels between 25 and 75 nmol/L as subclinical deficiency and levels above 75 nmol/L are sufficient (Cianferotti #). Bone-related diseases such as rickets, osteomalacia and myopathy arise when extreme deficiency is reached. The subclinical deficiency does not show symptoms of these diseases butâ€¦ Studies have shown that lack of vitamin D can be associated with a wide range of disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Cianferotti #).\n",
    "Vitamin D therefore plays an important role in the health of humans. Studies have also shown that a large number of individuals do not have adequate levels of vitamin D and this number will increase (Cianferotti #). Awareness of the damage sun exposure provides our skin people will minimize their exposure and use protection such as sunscreen. This will lower the the vitamin D levels and making the levels depend solely on food intake. Therefore making vitamin D as a supplement will benefit the overall health of the population. \n",

    "Budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is one of the most used microorganisms in human history [X].The first evidence of the use of microorganisms is suspected to involve some kind of yeast, plausibly S. cerevisiae, and dates back to XXXX BCE [X]. Today, this wonderful organism is used in a wide variety of productions, ranging from ethanol [X] to biomass[X], and small organic compounds[X] to cancer medication[X].\n",
    "\n",
    "One important difference between S. cerevisiae and all used bacterial microorganisms is that yeasts are eukaryotes, which means they have, among other things, cellular compartments. This makes a large difference in terms of complexity, as transport between different compartments needs to be factored in, but it also allows for more complex pathways to be split up between  locations where the local environment might be more hospitable. Furthermore, due to the large usage of the organism, it has been extensively studied, and is popular for usage in the industry, making it a good candidate for the production of vitamins and other biochemicals as well as proteins. [10.1186/s12934-015-0281-x]\n",
    "The yeast also has many well-established DNA cassettes, making construction of the strain more efficient[kilde]\n",
    "\n",
    "While the organism has many advantages and is widely used, it has some drawbacks as well. Usually, industry and academia has used glucose and disaccharides as substrate and carbon source, however this is neither environmentally sustainable, nor is it cheap. From these perspectives, it would be more advantageous to use a strain which can naturally use cellulose, lignin or xylose as substrate, which are abundant in nature.\n",
    "Another issue using S. cerevisieae can be the unwanted production of ethanol (even under aerobic conditions, dubbed the crabtree effect), since the cell factor will divert the carbon and energy towards production of EtOH rather than the wanted metabolite. [10.1186/s12934-015-0281-x]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why S. cerevisiae is so prevalent in the biotechnological sphere, among them being its fast growth rate, high production capacity, and it relative simplicity for an eukaryote.  [kilde?]\n"
